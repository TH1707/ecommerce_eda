# Ecommerce Data Analysis

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an ecommerce dataset from Kaggle. It provides insights into orders, revenue, top products, and country-wise sales performance using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Project Overview

- Load and clean the ecommerce dataset.
- Calculate basic statistics such as total orders and average order value.
- Compute total revenue generated by each product.
- Identify the top-selling product.
- Visualize the top 10 countries by revenue with a bar plot.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains transactional data including order invoices, product descriptions, quantities, unit prices, and countries.

## How to Run

1. Upload the dataset file (`data.csv`) to your environment.
2. Run the Python script or Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis code.
3. The script will output key statistics and display a bar chart of top revenue-generating countries.

## Key Features

- Calculation of total unique orders.
- Average quantity of products per order.
- Total revenue computation.
- Identification of the best-selling product.
- Visualization of country-wise revenue distribution.

## Libraries Used
